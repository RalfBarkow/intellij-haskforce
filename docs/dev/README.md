# HaskForce Developer Guide

The goal of this guide is to provide basic documentation of how HaskForce is
implemented and to make it easier for people to contribute and keep track of
all of the intricacies involved when developing an IntelliJ custom language plugin.

There is currently some documentation on the
[wiki](https://github.com/carymrobbins/intellij-haskforce/wiki);
however, we will try to transition most of it here to keep it versioned in the same
repo.

At the moment, this documentation is pretty minimal, but hopefully over time we can
iteratively update these docs as new challenges come up and are resolved.
